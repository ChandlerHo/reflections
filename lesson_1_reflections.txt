How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

The plus and minus signs showed me the difference right away.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

You can revert to previous codes easily.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

there's no logical point when it is automatically saved. however, sometimes people forget to submit changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

it is a matter of preference to me.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

 um, i don't know the ansewr yet

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

 You don't have to worry about losing what you have coded.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

saving this file. tracking changes
